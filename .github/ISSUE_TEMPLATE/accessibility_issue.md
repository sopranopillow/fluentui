<!--
Providing an isolated reproduction of the issue in a codepen makes it much easier for us to help you. Here are some ways to get started:

  * Go to https://aka.ms/fabricpen for a starter codepen
  * You can also use the "Export to Codepen" feature for the various components in our documentation site.
  * See http://codepen.io/dzearing/pens/public/?grid_type=list for a variety of examples

Alternatively, you can also use https://aka.ms/fabricdemo to get permanent repro links if the repro occurs with an example.
(A permanent link is preferable to "use the website" as the website can change.)
